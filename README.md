# DeepCancerSignatures

This repository contains code used to build and interpret a deep learning model.
It is a DNN classifier trained using gene expression data (TCGA).
Then is interpreted to identify cancer specific gene expression signatures.  

repository contains following jupyter notebooksi and should be used in order below, 
1. Model.ipynb
- train test deep learning models 

2. ShapInterpretation.ipynb
- shap value calculation for each feature 

3. Top20 genes
